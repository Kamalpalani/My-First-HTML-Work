<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have born in a lower middle class family , My parents spent most of their earning in my education even in most 
  tough situtaion.I was been made to taught at Private schoo where as all my neighbours and relatives studied in Government school.
  My father is Carpenter by Profession and my mother is a home maker, who is so religious spents most of her time in 
  workshipping various gods and spends her time by talking to close relatives sometime.My father is adamant does not understand
  the reality just talks what he like and doesnt care about others, he is so self concerned about himself and his family.</p>

  MEENAKSHI COLLEGE OF ENGGINEERING , K .K NAGAR,CHENNAI.I also completed B.LIS (Bachelor of Library and Information 
  Science) and M.LIS(Master of Library and Information Science) by Distance Education at Annamalai University</p>

  executive at Kelambakkam branch just spent hardly 2 months where I was not interested at that job so left it and joined at 
  DEAL private firm at Nungambakkam, Chennai it was nice job with small salary, days went there but my innerfeel had always
  has a choice to move toward the career in which I studied that is MECHANICAL Oriented works then I got shifted to SUNDARAM 
  FASTENER as Trainee, unfortunately I am totaly unhappy abou the work where I have to work as CNC operator which I hated the 
  most I had quit that job within 2 weeks , then with help of my classmate DINESH I got an Oppurtunityto attend interview at
  an Electronic company called SANMINA India Pvt.Ltd, My good time I have been selected for the post of Management Trainee in
  Industrial Enggineering Department in 2016 there, which was my first experience to work in Corporate Manufacturing firm

  sent to Interview round, I always had a confident to clear in the Interview round , because I believe that I can make trust 
  people and convince them, I had just gave a try, few months later I got an Offer letter from CSIR-SERC which I never expected,
